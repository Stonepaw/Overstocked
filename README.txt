Overstocked

Tired of grinding for crates? Overstocked makes the garage shelves automatically restock when a crate is taken.

IMPORTANT! When a crate is placed on an empty shelve it is not saved until a save action occurs. This can be done by starting a resturant or using the gragage to combine items.
