# Overstocked

Tired of grinding for crates? Overstocked makes the garage shelves automatically restock when a crate is taken. Multiplayer safe, only the host needs to have this mod installed.

Auto restocking can be turned off temporarily via the Mod Preferences menu.

IMPORTANT! When a crate is placed on an empty shelve it is not saved until a save action occurs. This can be done by starting a resturant or using the gragage workshop to combine items.
